Computer Basics:
-Complex machine made up of hardware and software
-Hardware is the part that you can touch, and there are many parts like the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and hard disk
-CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is like the human brain and calculates things fast
-More CPU result in a faster device
-RAM, or Random Access Memory, is like a scratchpad, or notes used temporarily
-The hard disk stores information in the back, like notes that you can look back at

-Software controls everything in a computer, or other device
-Operating system is one part of the software, and it controls and turn the device on and off
-Different operating systems for a phone and computer, like Windows and IOS
-The program is a set of instructions, and an important part of the software
-Consists of the instruction and data, or the command and argument (data needed for the instruction to be executed)

Binary system:
-Programming language
-Unlike the decimal system, it consists of two bases, 0 and 1
-Indefinite numbers, symbols, and letters can be represented using 0,1, place values, and exponents
-Use powers of 2 (1,2,4,8,16...) to make up a certain number
-To determine the numbers, you go from highest to lowest
-Example is the number 10, or 1010 in the binary system
-We started from the highest number below 10, which is 8. Adding 4 to 8 would be too high, so we use 2 instead. 
8 and 2 to equal 10, so 10 would be 1010. Note that 1 and 4 aren't included in the equation, because they don't make up the number 10
