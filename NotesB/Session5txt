Take Input From User:
Program
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.print("first number:");
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		int firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();
		
		System.out.print("second number:");
		int secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();
	}
}

-Declaring variable scanner of type Scanner
-Calling method nextInt to get user input

Writing a Program:
-Have a mental picture of how the program will look like
ex: Taking two numbers and writing the minimum and maximum. 
When you run the program, it asks the first and second #, and prints it as the minimum # is: and the maximum # is:
-Think about how to solve it, using examples
ex: To find out which is maximum or minimum, you need to know which is less or more. FOr example, if you have the numbers 20 and 40, 
you know 20 is the minimum because it is less than 40
-Write out the logical conditions
ex:if first number is less than second number then
    minimum = first number
    maximum = second number
otherwise
    minimum = second number
    maximum = first number
-Put into programming language. Write the syntax first. 
ex:  if(){

    }else{

    }

ex:  if( firstNumber < secondNumber){
        System.out.println("Minimum is:" + firstNumber);
        System.out.println("Maximum is:" + secondNumber);
    }else{

        System.out.println("Minimum is:" + secondNumber);
        System.out.println("Maximum is:" + firstNumber);

Condiitonal Program:
-% is used for getting the remainder
ex: 5 % 2 = 1
    6 % 2 = 0
    7 % 2 = 1
    8 % 2 = 0
Goal: find out whether a number is even or odd using % operation
Pseudo logic: if number % 2 value is 0 then 
		number is even
	      otherwise
		number is odd
Code:
    import java.util.Scanner;

public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.print("give number:");
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		int number = scanner.nextInt();
		
		// number % 2 is zero it is even
		// else it is odd
		
		if(number %2 == 0) {
			System.out.println(number + " is even");
		}else {
			System.out.println(number + " is odd");
		}

	}
}

Loop Program:
Goal: Take a number from user and print multiplication table up to 10

Pseudo logic: 
number = user input
starting from 1 to 10
	number * counter

Syntax: 
   for( ;   ;  ){

    }
Program:
import java.util.*;
public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("table number:");
		int number = scanner.nextInt();
		for(int i=1; i<=10; i++) {
			int answer = number * i;
			System.out.println(answer);
		}
	}
}
