Misconceptions:
-Name is a variable, start/stop are methods
-Objects: c1 and c2 are created
	-Accessed by calling them: c1.name = "Bob";
-Methods are called by invoking them: c1..start();

Constructors:
-Have a certain name or quality every time you call on it

-Class called Person (without main)
	Have name, age, height
-In the main, when you create your data type, you need to put in p1.name
	If you don't have this, it will come up as null
-Constructor
Person p1 = new Person("Bob");

-Now, even if you don't call on the field, it won't come as null, it will include the name Bob


-Class Person

Person(String inputname) {
name = input name
}

-Assign the inputname to name
