Method Overloading:
-Create a student class, and application class
-Have a variable called name
	-Create a constructor for name
-Create a method called readBook, with the input value being the bookName
-Create another method, with the same name readBook, this time taking two parameters or inputvalues
	-bookName, minutesToRead
-Create another method with three parameters
	-readBook( bookName, minutesToRead, pagesToRead)
-Create a method called readBook where there are no parameters

  public class Student{
        void readBook(String bookName){
            System.out.println("Reading book:" + bookName)
        }

        void readBook(String bookName, int minutesToRead){
            System.out.println("Reading book:" + bookName + " for " + minutesToRead);
        }

        void readBook(String bookName, int minutesToRead, int pagesToRead){
            System.out.println("Reading book:" + bookName + " for " + minutesToRead + " and " + pagesToRead);
        }

        void readBook(){
            System.out.println("Reading my own book for whatever minutes I want and pages");
        }
    }

-Define these methods and parameters in the application class

  public class Application{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            Student s1 = new Student();
            s1.readBook("Harry Potter");  
            s1.readBook("Harry Potter", 30);   
            s1.readBook("Harry Potter", 30, 20);   
            s1.readBook();    
        }
    }

-The methods runs the parameter with the appropriate method in Student class
-Method overloading: Allows many methods with the same now, a long as the parameters are different

For parameters, the datatype also matters
Ex:     class Student{
        void readBook(String bookName, int minutesToRead){

        }
        
        void readBook(String bookName, int pagesToRead){

        }
    }

-This will not work, as String and int are in the same place- 
It will work if you switc the order for the second method


Char data type (short for character):
-Stores a single character
Ex:    char grade = 'A';
