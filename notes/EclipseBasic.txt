{ } is the function, need } at end
each line should have ; at end

System.out.println(""); this prints the words in the quotation marks

x = 2 (assignment)
x == 2 (comparing, in this case it is true because we wrote x = 2 in the above line)
Syntax: grammer for programmming, example is the ;
Data types - - variable - - value
ex: int age = 15

Repetition:
for loop

int x;
		for(x=0; x<10; x=x+1) {
			System.out.println("Hello World");
		}

First, x=0
It checks t0 make sure x<10, and because it is true, it prints the instruction (helloworld)
Then, it goes back, does x=x+1, and adds 1 to 0 which makes x=1
It checks again to make sure x<10, and because it is true, it prints it again
Again, it adds 1 to 1, which makes it 2. It checks to make sure x<10, which is true, so it prints the line. 
It stops printing after 10 times, because on the 11th time, x=10 which is not less than 10
